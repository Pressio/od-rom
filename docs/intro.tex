\PB{Insert boilerplate discussion  about the need for ROMs here, with a focus on many-query problems in particular. } \\

Motivations for ODROM: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Many hyper-reduction techniques lack robustness/accuracy guarantees in practice and in theory (cite Ben's work showing probabilistic bounds \cite{peherstorfer2020stability}). ROMs need to be more robust for widespread usage, and while over-sampling for hyper-reduction can work, it comes at a computational cost. 
\item Classic projection-based ROMs struggle with advection-dominated problems; nonlinear basis approaches show promise, but are expensive to train
\item Existing localized reduced-basis ROMs are derived for elliptic problems \cite{ohlberger2015error,antonietti2016discontinuous}; need a more generalized approach to extend to parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations. 
\item Classic projection-based ROMs are not designed with HPC hardware in mind; we should design ROMs that can exploit modern (and future) computing devices, especially when used for solving many-query problems such as uncertainty quantification, parameter estimation, and design optimization. 
\end{itemize}
