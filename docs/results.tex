In this section, we present and discuss numerical results for the od-rom.
Our goal is to use these results to clearly convey specific messages about this work.
Specifically, we first want to show the expressive properties of the basis, ....
Therefore, we organize this section ``by message''.
For a given message/point to make, we show results for multiple problems.




We use the following problems: the shallow-water equations in two dimensions, the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion problem.
These problems are taken from \href{https://pressio.github.io/pressio-demoapps}{\textsf{pressio-demoapps}} (PDA).
PDA is an open-source project developed at Sandia National Laboratory that is aimed at providing benchmark ROM cases, and is part of the \href{https://pressio.github.io/}{\textsf{Pressio}} ecosystem.
PDA include a cell-centered finite volume-based solver equipped with several flux schemes, exact Jacobians, sample mesh capabilities, and benchmark cases in one, two, and three dimensions.

\subsection{Shallow Water Equations}

The problem is described with the following system of PDE

\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial hu}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial hv}{\partial y} &= 0 \\
  \frac{\partial hu}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial }{\partial x} (hu^2 + \frac{1}{2}g h^2) + \frac{\partial huv}{\partial y} &= -\mu v \\
  \frac{\partial hv}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial huv}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial }{\partial y} (hv^2 + \frac{1}{2}g h^2) &= \mu u
\end{align}

where $h$ is the fluid column height, $g$ is gravity, $(u, v)$ are the fluid's horizontal velocities averaged across the vertical column.
The domain is $[-5, 5]^2$ with slip-wall BCs and initial condition: $h = 1 + \alpha \exp( -(x-1)^2 - (y-1)^2)$, $u = v = 0$,
with $\alpha = 1/8$ (initial pulse magnitude), $g = 9.8$ (gravity parameter), $\mu = -3.0$ (Coriolis parameter).
